## Installation

**System Requirements:**
- macOS **14 Sonoma** or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

---

### Option 1: Download and Install Manually

<a href="https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch/releases/latest/download/boringNotch.dmg" target="_self"><img width="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3179be1-8416-4b8a-b417-743e1ecc67d6" alt="Download for macOS" /></a>

Once downloaded, open the `.dmg` and move **Notching it up** to your `/Applications` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We don't have an Apple Developer account (yet 👀), so macOS will warn you that Notching it up is from an unidentified developer on first launch. This is expected behavior.
>
> You'll need to bypass this before the app will open. You only need to do this once. Use one of the methods below.

---

#### Recommended: Terminal (Always Works)

This is the quickest and easiest method. It only requires a single command and works consistently for all users. System Settings can sometimes fail and won't work for non-admin users.

After moving Notching it up to your Applications folder, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Notching it up.app"
```

Then open the app normally.

---

#### Alternative: System Settings

> [!NOTE]
> This method doesn't work for all users. If this doesn't work, use the Terminal method above.

1. Try to open the app — you'll see a security warning.
2. Click **OK** to dismiss it.
3. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click **Open Anyway** next to the Notching it up warning.
5. Confirm if prompted.

## Usage

- Launch the app, and voilà—your notch is now the coolest part of your screen.
- Hover over the notch to see it expand and reveal all its secrets.
- Use the controls to manage your music like a rockstar.
- Click the star in your menu bar to customize your notch to your heart's content.
